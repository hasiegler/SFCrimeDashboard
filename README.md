Its primary aim is to enable users to see where crimes are occuring and gain insights into the types of crimes that occur in various areas of the city, and the times when such crimes are more likely to take place. Through the use of this application, users can acquire an informed understanding of the patterns and trends in criminal activity in San Francisco, and stay updated on the latest information regarding reported crimes in the city. The application employs various visualization techniques to represent the data in an easy-to-understand format, facilitating users to explore the data and comprehend the crime situation in the city with greater clarity.

To fetch the daily crime data, the application uses an API offered by the San Francisco Police Department.
